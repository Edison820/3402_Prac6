Learning Activities & Resources slack, GitHub, trello
Estimated hours About 1 and a half hours

In week 6, we form our own groups. We also established a discussion group in Slack as a chat tool to connect with each other. We also established groups in GitHub and trello, established project plans and the behaviors that team members need to standardize. Trello is a user-friendly project management tool that uses boards, lists, and cards to help individuals and teams organize tasks visually. And Slack excels in optimizing team communication with its real-time messaging and organized channels, fostering efficient collaboration. The platform's seamless integration with third-party tools facilitates easy file sharing and updates. Thatâ€™s why slack and trello were chosen.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: Through this week's study, I learned to simply use slack, GitHub, and trello to improve the efficiency of group work. At the same time, we also standardized the order of the group and what everyone should do.
